* Describe the use case you have chosen
- Cost estimation early in design phase. By extracting quantities of walls, beams, columns and slabs used in the building the cost of the structural model will be estimated. The quantities and properties of the material will be used along with cost data to determine whether or not to make changes to the structure, and also provide the cost effects of additions and modifications. 

* Who is the use case for?
- Contractor, project manager and cost manager. 

* What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case
- A combination of what we have learned in courses on economics, structural engineering and material technology. We also have experience doing cost estimation from our bachelor thesis, where we compared different building designs based on cost.

* What IFC concepts did you use in your script (would you use in your script)
- IfcRelDefinesByProperties, (file.by_type), ifcMaterialLayer, IfcMaterialLayerSet

* What disciplinary analysis does it require?
- Cost analysis of materials

* What building elements are you interested in?
- Beams, walls, columns and slabs

* What (use cases) need to be done before you can start your use case?
- Architectural design, fundamental structural analysis.

* What is the input data for your use case?
- Material quantities, dimensions and properties. 

* What other use cases are waiting for your use case to complete?
- Fire, acoustics, indoor climate, daylight, code validation, build & operate.
